BIG NOTES:
-might want to abstract out all the input code from our dispaly class
	- if we do that, note that the input is still GLFW dependent at the moment
-currently can only load shaders programs that consist of a vertex and fragment shader, and nothing else (ex. a shader with a geometry shader)
-want to get fullscreen functionality actually working properly
